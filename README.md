# CST435 Assignment 2: Parallel and Cloud Computing
This repository contains the implementation of a Python MapReduce program as part of CST435 - Parallel and Cloud Computing, Semester 1, 2024/2025. The assignment involves using cloud infrastructure and platform stacks such as Docker, Apache Hadoop, and Kubernetes (MicroK8s) to solve a problem using parallel processing techniques.

The example Python MapReduce program is from: https://github.com/robertdefilippi/hadoop-python-mapreduce/blob/master/mapper.py
